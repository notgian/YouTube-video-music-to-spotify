# YouTube-video-music-to-spotify

A simple project obtains the music that YouTube detects on a video and ports them onto a Spotify playlist using the Spotify Web API. It is a simple web app, which is relatively self explanatory for the user. The user can choose to provide a link for an existing playlist if they wish, or set a name for the playlist to be created. The absence of both fields will default to the creation of a playlist with the name of the youtube video.
